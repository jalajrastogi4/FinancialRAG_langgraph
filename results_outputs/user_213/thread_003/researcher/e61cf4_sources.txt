- Total revenue for 2024 was $164.50 billion, an increase of 22% compared to 2023. Revenue on a constant currency basis would have increased 23%.
- Ad impressions delivered across our Family of Apps in 2024 increased 11% year-over-year, and our average price per ad increased 10% year-over-year.
- Income from operations for 2024 was $69.38 billion, an increase of $22.63 billion, or 48%, compared to 2023. The increase in costs and expenses was mainly due to increases in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and employee compensation.
- Interest and other income (expense), net in 2024 increased $606 million compared to 2023, mostly due to an increase in interest income from a combination of higher balances and interest rates, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on our long-term debt.
- Our provision for income taxes in 2024 decreased $27 million compared to 2023, due to a decrease in the effective tax rate (12% in 2024 vs 18% in 2023). Our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon various items, and we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2025 to be in the range of 12-15%.
- Cash used in financing activities during 2024 mostly consisted of $30.13 billion for repurchases of our Class A common stock, $5.07 billion of payments of dividends and dividend equivalents, and $13.77 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of RSUs, partially offset by $10.43 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of additional Notes in August 2024.
- Free cash flow: $52,103 million in 2024, compared to $43,010 million in 2023.
- Foreign currency exchange losses, net: (690) million in 2024.
- Mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses incurred in 2024, as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act). The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our 2024 cash tax liabilities materially but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. If the mandatory capitalization is deferred, our effective tax rate in 2025 could be higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be lower.
- A number of countries have enacted legislation to implement the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's 15% global minimum tax regime with effect from January 1, 2024. These changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for 2024. We continue to evaluate the impacts of proposed and enacted legislation with respect to the global minimum tax regime in the jurisdictions we operate in. As additional jurisdictions enact legislation, transitional relief expires, and other provisions of the minimum tax legislation become effective, our effective tax rate and cash tax payments could increase in future years.
