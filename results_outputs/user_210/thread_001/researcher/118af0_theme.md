### Summary
Amazon demonstrated a strong positive trend in its cash flow metrics from 2023 into 2024. Cash flow from operations saw substantial increases, moving from $84,946 million in full-year 2023 to $115,877 million in full-year 2024. Quarterly trailing twelve-month figures also show consistent growth in operating cash flow throughout 2023 and 2024, indicating robust core business performance.

Capital expenditures, defined as purchases of property and equipment net of proceeds from sales and incentives, saw a slight decrease in the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, from $(57,649) million to $(48,998) million. However, full-year capital expenditures increased significantly from $(48,133) million in 2023 to $(77,658) million in 2024, and quarterly TTM figures for June and September 2024 also show an increase compared to the prior year. This suggests increased investment in property and equipment towards the latter half of 2024.

Consequently, free cash flow experienced a remarkable turnaround and substantial growth. From a negative free cash flow of $(3,319) million in the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2023, it surged to $50,149 million by March 31, 2024. This positive trend continued, reaching $52,973 million by June 30, 2024, and $42,953 million by September 30, 2024. The significant improvement in free cash flow indicates Amazon's increased ability to generate cash after accounting for capital investments, allowing for greater financial flexibility.
